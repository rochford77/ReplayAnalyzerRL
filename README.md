
### About
ReplaySnatcher.js is a discord bot, can be used to gather replay files from a discord server. 
I have it running on my pi.

replayAnalyzer.py is a wrapper for [carball](https://github.com/SaltieRL/carball) 

This feeds carball in batches of replay files and outputs advanced stats 

Stats are grouped by player and team. 

### Requirements
This project requires python 3.6.2 and carball.

`pip install carball`

`python ./replayAnalyzer.py`
